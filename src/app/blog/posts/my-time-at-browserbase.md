title: "Reflections on 6 months at Browserbase"
date: "2025-08-"

---

August marks the sixth month I've been officially employed at [Browserbase](https://browserbase.com). Being only 20, I've never had a job for more than a few months, even my summer jobs back when I was in high school.

Other than [wrestling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OE4MznrxOE), I've never had to commit to something for so long. It's taught me a lot about myself and now feels like a good time to reflect and think about how committing myself to a company for so long has changed the way I live my life.

### What is Browserbase? 

The central gateway to the internet is the web browser. With a browser, users can both read from and write to the internet. 

Humans use google chrome, safari, etc. as their browser. But AI agents use Browserbase as their gateway to the modern internet. 
To this date, many of our customers use us for 3 main things: 

<ul>
<li>• Web scraping</li>
<li>• Web automation</li>
<li>• Web agents</li>
</ul>

We offer 3 main products:

<ul>
<li>• Browserbase: the browser cloud and infrastructure</li>
<li>• Stagehand: our OSS AI web automation framework</li>
<li>• Director: our no code workflow automation builder</li>
</ul>

Like [Vercel](https://vercel.com), we're pioneering a new market in the age of AI as the defacto Browser Cloud. 

### My story? 

We'll start from the beginning. I joined this company back in march in a bit of an unorthodox way. Rather than apply for the position through an official job application, I actually stumbled upon a DM on twitter from Paul Klein IV, the founder and CEO.

>"Yo how have we not met yet?"

We traded messages and he told me to stop by the office. So I hitched a ride to SF and came into the office to meet him. 

I mostly asked questions about founding, what it's like to have a company get acquired, how do you raise money so quickly, how to fall into pmf, etc. 

The one thing I still remember from our conversation in a lyft to pick up lunch was it's really important to build painkillers, not vitamins. The rest is history. I did some official interview rounds with the team, with some strong recs from Paul and my good friend Alex, and started my first week in person end of march while on spring break.

It was a blast, sleeping on my friends couching as coming in for work was awesome. It was honestly super energizing compared to the dreadful probability theory courses I was sitting in at UCLA. 

### Working Remote 

After spring break, I had to go back to school in down in LA, which is 5 hours driving from SF. Not exactly a commutable distance. 

I converted to remote and worked FT hours while going to school. I mostly skipped my lectures and found a way to get by in my courses while putting a majority of my effort in to my wrk and trying to learn from the team as much as I could. 

I even flew up to SF a couple times during the quarter and popped in to work while I was there. I distinctly remember working on rewriting and relaunching our MCP server, which had become a huge growth lever for stagehand. Alex and I had spent a while creating more tools and refining the quality of the server and our launch ended up getting a pretty good amount of viewership. As of now, the server is at **2.5k** github stars.

I think I had a solid balance then of having fun with my friends at school and doing spontaneous things in LA, with working full time growing Browserbase. 

### Fulltime in Office

This summer I learned that I definitely prefer an in person culture. While some teams like Vercel, Railway, and Linear have found success in a remote first culture, I believe almost nothing can beat the feeling of being in office working on something you're super passionate about with people who share your beliefs. 

I moved up to SF after school ended, during a super busy month. We were ramping up for a huge launch: our $40M series B and Director: our no-code workflow automation builder. We worked early mornings and late nights and I was super pumped to get this across the line. Our launch was a success, my friend helped film and direct our launch video and we had hundreds of thousands of eyes on us.

<br />
The rest of the summer has been smooth sailing. I show up in the morning, try to absorb as much as I can during the day, then leave at night. We even went to Hawaii in the middle of the summer, which is an experience I don't think many other college interns will get to experience.

My day as the sole growth engineer usually consists of reviewing, creating, and publishing content across all of our platforms, as well as building tools to improve the efficiency of our GTM team. I've had stints across engineering teams, shipping code to the website, Stagehand, and even Director for a week and a half. 

I also spend a lot of time building demos to show people how to use Browserbase and introducing them to the product suite. 

Something I didn't expect to do all summer is spend a lot time in overall GTM function. It's been great learning a ton of things about rev ops, sales, ABM, and more. I can't believe that 3 months ago, I had no idea what any of those things ***really*** meant . 

I'm also working on a fun field marketing growth hack, where we're sending custom legos to ~30 of the hottest AI startups in SF.

### Whats next? 

I think a big reason why I wanted to work at Browserbase is because I want to start a company one day. Being at a company that's growing so fast with people that you admire is something that you cannot pass up. 

I'm super grateful for the opportunity to wake up in SF and work on projects that impact real people. It feels amazing to watch the work that you do move the needle for the company and bring all of us closer to our goals.
