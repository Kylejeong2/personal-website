This August marks six months at [Browserbase](https://browserbase.com). At 20, I've never held a job longer than a few months—not even summer gigs in high school.

Other than [wrestling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OE4MznrxOE), I've never committed to something this long. It's taught me a lot about myself and now feels like a good time to reflect on how this commitment has changed my life.

### What is Browserbase? 

The central gateway to the internet is the web browser. With a browser, users can both read from and write to the internet. 

Humans use google chrome, safari, etc. as their browser. But AI agents use Browserbase as their gateway to the modern internet. 
Many customers use us for three main things: 

<ul>
<li>• Web scraping</li>
<li>• Web automation</li>
<li>• Web agents</li>
</ul>

We offer 3 main products:

<ul>
<li>• Browserbase: the browser cloud and infrastructure</li>
<li>• Stagehand: our OSS AI web automation framework</li>
<li>• Director: our no code workflow automation builder</li>
</ul>

Like [Vercel](https://vercel.com), we're pioneering a new market in the age of AI as the defacto Browser Cloud. 

### My story

We'll start from the beginning. I joined this company back in March in a bit of an unorthodox way. Rather than apply for the position through an official job application, I actually received a DM on twitter from Paul Klein IV, the founder and CEO.

>"Yo how have we not met yet?"
![Original DM](/blog/browserbase/dm.png)

We traded messages and he told me to stop by the office. So I hitched a ride to SF and came into the office to meet him. 

I mostly asked questions about founding, what it's like to have a company get acquired, how do you raise money so quickly, how to find PMF, etc. 

One thing stuck: "You should always build painkillers, not vitamins." The rest is history. I went through the official interview process, then started my first in-person week at the end of March during spring break.

It was a blast—crashing on a friend's couch, coming in for work. Super energizing compared to the dreadful probability theory courses at UCLA. 

### Working Remote

After spring break, I had to go back to school in down in LA, which is 5 hours driving from SF. Not exactly a commutable distance. 

I went remote, working full-time while in school. I mostly skipped lectures, got by in courses, and focused most of my effort on work—learning from the team as much as possible. 

I even flew up to SF a couple times during the quarter and popped in to work while I was there. I distinctly remember working on rewriting and relaunching our MCP server, which had become a huge growth lever for Stagehand. I spent a while creating more tools and refining the quality of the server and our launch ended up getting a pretty good amount of viewership. As of now, the server is at **2.5k** github stars.

I think I had a solid balance then of having fun with my friends at school and doing spontaneous things in LA, with working full time growing Browserbase. 

### Fulltime in Office

This summer taught me I prefer in-person culture. While teams like Vercel, Railway, and Linear succeed remotely, nothing beats office energy—working on something you're passionate about with like-minded people. 

I moved up to SF after school ended, during a super busy month. We were ramping up for a huge launch: our $40M series B and Director: our no-code workflow automation builder. We worked early mornings and late nights and I was super pumped to get this across the line. Our launch was a success, my friend helped film and direct our launch video and we had hundreds of thousands of eyes on us.

  </tr>

<br />
The rest of the summer has been smooth sailing. I show up in the morning, try to absorb as much as I can during the day, then leave at night. We even went to Hawaii in the middle of the summer, which is an experience I don't think many other college interns will get to experience.

As the sole growth engineer, my days involve reviewing, creating, and publishing content across platforms, plus building tools to boost GTM team efficiency. I've done stints across engineering teams, shipping code to the website, Stagehand, and Director. 

I also spend a lot of time building demos to show people how to use Browserbase and introducing them to the product suite. 

Something I didn't expect to do all summer is spend a lot time in overall GTM function. It's been great learning a ton of things about rev ops, sales, ABM, and more. I can't believe that 3 months ago, I had no idea what any of those things ***really*** meant . 

I'm also working on a fun field marketing growth hack, where we're sending custom legos to ~30 of the hottest AI startups in SF.

### What's next?

I think a big reason why I wanted to work at Browserbase is because I want to start a company one day. Being at a company that's growing so fast with people that you admire is something that you cannot pass up. 

I'm super grateful for the chance to wake up in SF and work on projects impacting real people. It feels amazing watching your work move the needle, and bring us closer to our goals.
